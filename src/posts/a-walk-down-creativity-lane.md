Two weeks ago a friend and I participated in a game jam, and as a result, made
[Rodent Robbery](https://sscsc.itch.io/rodent-robbery) (sorry, it's windows
only). For the uninitiated, game jams are basically hackathons, but for building
games. I haven't built any games for a long time, but the ashes of this passion
lay smoldering in the back of my mind, waiting for someone (else?) to stoke
them.

And stoked they became. Some of you might believe that drawing and painting is
all I have ever done, but let's look back to revisit (and rekindle) forgotten
flames.

## The Awakening

I was a LEGO kid growing up. I built sets, tore them down, and then used the
bricks for their intended purpose - in my own creations. One day in middle
school, I watched a Youtube video of what appeared to be a movie, but with LEGO
characters, and they were moving by themselves. How could this be? I had
discovered stop-motion animation. When the medium is LEGO, the production is
affectionately referred to as a "brickfilm."

Anyway, this spurred in me the art of cinematography. I dipped my toes into scriptwriting,
storyboarding, lighting, sound effects, post-processing, not to mention that
actual art of stop-motion animation. It was hard, and I wasn't great, but I was
learning a lot. Eventually I produced a film using BIONICLE (another LEGO line,
because I was really in to that). I physically cringe when I hear my voice
acting, but you can check it out
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0XVm1Lv4cM). Later, I submitted a short
film for a workplace PSA contest and actually won 2nd place (with a monetary
prize), which basically made me a semi-professional filmmaker. I wish I had the
original file, but for an idea of what the animation was like,
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSVebW6EbE) is the last animation test I
have. For my final link, I give you the finest brickfilm to grace my eyes:
[Unrenewable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djA4qJgifzc).

## A New World

As I got more and more into film production, I needed to figure out how vfx was
done. How is good looking smoke made, and how can I put planes in the sky
without holding the plane in every frame? That led me to discover
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/), the 3D creation suite. For the second time,
my world changed.

Was this how Pixar and Disney made their films? Was this how Crash Bandicoot and
Sonic the Hedgehog were manifested? And I'm allowed to do the same, for free?
That's a bit of an exaggeration, but suddenly I came into contact with a world
that, until then, I was merely a consumer of. Now I could become the creator?
Blender was only in version 2.5 back then (we are at 4.3, about 14 years later), and it was intimidating, but I
learned about 3D modeling, animation, rigging, texturing, rendering, vfx, and
compositing. It was hard (again), and I wasn't great (again), but I was learning
a lot (again). I stopped doing stop-motion animation and joined a community of
folks building a LEGO fan game that was effectively a BIONICLE version of Super
Smash Bros. I was an animator working with random strangers, and from it I
learned how unreliable random strangers can be. This was also around the time I
was learning programming (my junior year of high school?), which meant
that game development was falling rapidly into my lap (my brother was actually a
programmer for said fan game).

Because of my interest in game development, I tangentially stumbled upon the
role of concept artist. Seeing environment concept art for games was the coolest
thing I had ever seen. And so, while all of what I previously said was
happening, I also started figuring out how one makes ... that kind of art.

## Changing of the Times

I shipped out to UC Berkeley to study electrical engineering and computer
science. When I wasn't doing problem sets, I would find some time to draw. I
painted this mug on a Friday evening, which was met with much laughter by my floor
mates at the time. I have forgiven, but not forotten (I'm kidding, maybe).

During my sophomore (I think) winter break, my brother and I made and published a
game called _The Sharpest Blade_. I don't have any videos of it, and I don't
think it works on modern operating systems now, but it was a simple puzzle
platformer where the only clue you had was the name of the level. I made the
backgrounds and character art while my brother did all of the programming. The
hardest part about building games is actually finishing it. The last 10% of
polish takes 90% of the time.

I had the exciting opportunity to take a year long class called "CNM190 Advanced
Digital Animation," in which a group of twenty-four students, half studying art and half studying computer science (who had taken computer graphics),
would be split into two teams and each produce a 30 second animated film. We
studied the art of storyboarding, look development, and the pipeline for making
films at scale. I enjoyed it, but I was forced to learn Maya (industry standard
3D creation suite), which I found
obtuse compared to Blender. Perhaps the most difficult task, however, was
managing 12 people on one project.

In my last year I took the opportunity to host the Berkeley Chapter of 2016
Global Game Jam. It was a successful event, with 45 folks (not just students)
showing up to work 48 hours to build some games. It would be my last major
foray into game development.

## You Can't Have it All

I was working as a software engineer in San Francisco, drawing on my commute to
work, and fiddling with some game dev on the way back. But for as much as I had
done, I wasn't good at anything. The truth was, I was a dabbler,
and I hated myself for it. I took stock of what I knew and what I felt was
reasonable, and decided I was going to keep drawing as my creative outlet. It
was a rational choice. I didn't need a computer to practice it, it didn't
require developing a plethora of skills (wrong), and it exposed me to people
from a variety of backgrounds. I suffocated all my other flames, attached my
self-worth to only the one remaining, and let it burn.

## The Fire Spreads

As it turns out, I'm good at burning. I tore my ACL playing soccer, which meant
that fate had snuffed out my non-creative flame too (at least, temporarily).
It caused me great anguish, but it also removed my distractions. It gave me
laser focus. I practiced. There's a famous quote by Ira Glass that is as
follows:

I took it to heart, but after a while I wasn't sure if I was doing it for the
love of the game, or for the love of who I thought I was going to become.
That troubled me, because only those who love the craft will stick around
long enough to see it through. There came a point where if I weren't doing a
study of some kind, I had no idea what to paint. It felt as if my practice had sharpened the blade of skill and left
dull that of creativity. I felt dull.

## Controlled Burn

Creativity can be learned. I can't say that I have learned it (I read a few
books and practiced creativity more meaningfully), but I have seen
enough artists' work over time to know that it isn't innate. It involves
consumption, but with a creator's eye.

I reached a point where I felt I would be better served by experimentation
instead of execution. You can see that in
in a lot of my work over time -- I play with lighting, texture, and perspective
in search of something that stretches my idea of what a finished artwork could
look like.

As I started to experiment, I began to like what I made. That helped me create more. I understand enough about myself
to realize what I really enjoy is a certain amount of difficulty. Every time I
make a painting, I (subconsciously) am looking for a
composition/subject that doesn't just inspire, but pushes me. These are
developments of the last two years.

This effort to learn creativity is what they mean when they say "creativity is a muscle." For it to grow, it
must be consciously worked. What I'm saying isn't novel, but I'm the type of guy
who only grows through what he goes through. Having worked on it for a
while, I can say that creativity
is best explored on the foundation of strong fundamentals. I have much further
to go.

## The Renaissance

_/ˈrenəˌsäns/ a revival of or renewed interest in something_

During all those years I spent practicing art, I kept tabs on my other flames.
Not dead, but smoldering. I never unsubscribed from the r/gamedev subreddit, and
I got a regular newsletter for all things 3D art from our savior Andrew Price of
Blender Guru. I kept up with open source game engine updates, and occasionally
watched talks from GDC (Game Developers Conference) every year. Each time I
would consume some content from the other side, I would feel a tug. The
suffocation I spoke of earlier was not a one time deal. I suffered through that
regularly, each time affirming that any worthy pursuit requires sacrifice,
and my sacrifice was curiosity.

When my friend, who was somewhat aware of my history, asked me if I want to
participate in a game jam, I hesitated. It felt like I'm bringing a mistress
into the fold, and it was dangerous (forgive me this metaphor, it fits too well). But a weekend couldn't hurt, right? Don't overthink it.

I was right to be concerned. As we were building the game, I began to feel the
heat of every previously subdued flame. A sublime intersection
of engineering, art, and storytelling exists here, and I yearned to explore it
all like I once did. But for that to happen, the primary fire I nutured must
burn with less vigor.

I made a choice a long time ago, and stayed the
course. The choice presented itself once more. This time, I chose
differently.

No man steps in the same river twice. For it is not the same river,
and he is not the same man.
